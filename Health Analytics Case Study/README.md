### To answer Q2 to Q8, we will create a temporary table.

````sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS user_measure_count;

CREATE TEMP TABLE user_measure_count AS(
SELECT
  id,
  COUNT(*) AS measure_count,
  COUNT(DISTINCT measure) AS unique_measure_count
FROM health.user_logs
GROUP BY id);
````

Alright, once we have created the temp table, let's move on to our questions.

### 2. How many total measurements do we have per user on average?

Question is asking for the **average number of measurements for all users**.

````sql
SELECT 
  ROUND(AVG(measure_count),2) AS avg_measurement
FROM user_measure_count;
````

### Looking at the logs data -
### 6. What is the number and percentage of the active user base who have logged blood glucose measurements?

````sql
SELECT
  measure,
  COUNT(DISTINCT id) as no_of_ids,
  ROUND(100 * COUNT(DISTINCT id)::NUMERIC / SUM(COUNT(DISTINCT id)) OVER (),2) AS blood_glucose_percentage
FROM
  health.user_logs
WHERE
  measure = 'blood_glucose'
GROUP BY
  measure;
````

### 7. What is the number and percentage of the active user base who have at least 2 types of measurements?

````sql
WITH measure_more_than_2 AS (
SELECT *
FROM user_measure_count
WHERE unique_measure_count >= 2)

SELECT
  COUNT(DISTINCT m.id) AS unique_user,
  ROUND(100 * COUNT(DISTINCT m.id)::numeric / COUNT(DISTINCT u.id),2) AS unique_user_percentage
FROM user_measure_count AS u
LEFT JOIN measure_more_than_2 AS m
  ON u.id = m.id;
````

### 8. What is the number and percentage of the active user base who have all 3 measures - blood glucose, weight and blood pressure?

````sql
WITH all_measures AS (
SELECT *
FROM user_measure_count
WHERE unique_measure_count = 3)

SELECT
  COUNT(DISTINCT m.id) AS unique_user,
  ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT m.id)::numeric / COUNT(DISTINCT u.id),2) AS unique_user_percentage

### 9. For users that have blood pressure measurements, what is the median systolic/diastolic blood pressure values?

````sql
SELECT
  'blood_pressure' AS measure_name,
  PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY systolic) AS systolic_median,
  PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY diastolic) AS diastolic_median
FROM health.user_logs
WHERE measure = 'blood_pressure';
